## Introduction

If you've ever needed to connect your Laravel project with SQL Server, you may have encountered delays in processing when using the Query Builder or the framework's ORM. These delays could be attributed to the extensive codebase supporting various database engines or other processing overhead.

Furthermore, the lack of support for all SQL Server versions adds to the challenge. To address these issues, this package was developed.

**This library is compatible with PHP +8.0 and Laravel versions 9.0 and higher**
